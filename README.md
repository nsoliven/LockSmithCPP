# LOCKSMITH - A C++ Based Password Manager

**Skills Demonstrated:** C++, SQLite, SQL, Cryptography, Object-Oriented Programming

**(!DB MANAGEMENT DONE!)**

üîê A minimalistic password manager application built with C++ and SQL for learning purposes.

## IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. **DATA IS NOT SECURE YET**
   - Data in the password manager is currently NOT hashed in any way.
   - Will be stored securely in the future, hashing and cryptography being worked on currently.

## User Installation

- Dependencies already included. Download is in the versions.

## User Compilation and Building
Windows:
- Please have CMAKE & GIT installed on your system for building
- Windows must have dos2unix to convert SQLiteCPP, Windows simply use VSCODE's CMAKE instead.

UNIX/LINUX Building:
- Please have CMAKE & GIT & GCC Compiler installed on your system for building
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nsoliven/LockSmithCPP
cd LockSmithCPP
git submodule init
git submodule update
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build ./ --config Debug --target all 
./lockSmithAPP
```

Note: If ask git asks, trust the repo with command provided

## User Flow

1. **Encryption and Data Storage:**
   - Password to the manager, it's encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES) using the Master Password as the key
   - Database contains list of accounts and passwords which are stored securely using said key
2. **Master Password:**
   - You set a master password during initial setup.
   - The master password is used directly as the data encryption key.
3. **Secure Authentication:**
   - When you open the password manager, you are prompted to enter your master password.
   - The entered master password is hashed and compared to the stored hash for authentication.
4. **Database Decryption:**
   - If the master password is correct, the password manager uses it to decrypt the database.
   - Your stored passwords are now accessible.
