# LOCKSMITH - A C++ Based Password Manager
_Author: NSoliven_

**Skills Demonstrated:** `C++`, `SQLite`, `SQL`, `Cryptography with ARGON2`, `Botan`, `Object-Oriented Programming`

üîê A minimalistic password manager application built with C++ and SQLite

## IMPORTANT NOTES ON SECURITY:

**PASSWORD SECURITY**
- Passwords are stored after being hashed/encrypted and salted (DEFAULT: `600,000` ITERATIONS)
  - Master Password is hashed with `ARGON2ID` stored in master_pass.hash along with salts and iterations, the user can choose iterations for Master Password.
    - _note on argon2: a state-of-the-art password hashing algorithm making it computationally expensive and time-consuming for attackers to crack._
  - Database Passwords (the user's passwords) are encrypted with `AES-256-GCM` using a key derived from the Master Password
    - _AES-256 is renowned for its exceptional strength, with a 256-bit key that makes it virtually unbreakable by brute-force attacks, even with the most powerful supercomputers._
 
**MEMORY SAFETY**
- Memory Safety using Botan's `Secure Vectors` where sensitive data occurs. The secure vectors are filled with random data as soon as possible and are not stored in swap at any time

**LOCALLY HOSTED**
- There are NO SERVERS that connect to your database at any time. All data is hosted within your private device ensuring maximum privacy and control

## User Installation
- Dependencies not needed, everything statically linked and included in executable files (lockSmithApp.exe and lockSmithApp.pm)

## User Compilation and Building
**Windows:**
- Please have CMAKE & GIT & CONAN installed on your system for building
- Locate your Conan profile at C:\Users\{USER}\.conan2\profiles
  - Change compiler.cppstd to compiler.cppstd=20
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nsoliven/LockSmithCPP
cd LockSmithCPP
conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing --settings=build_type=Debug # change to 'Release' for release mode
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=build/conan_toolchain.cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build

#location may be different depending on how you build
cd ./out/build/windows_release
./lockSmithAPP.exe
```

**UNIX/LINUX Building:**
